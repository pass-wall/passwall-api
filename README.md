## API Documentation
API documentation available at [Postman Public Directory](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/3658426/SzYbyHXj)

PassWall has both server and client side encryption. So when creating user to work with Postman you should use already SHA256 encrypted password in JSON or use a Postman Pre-request Script to encrypt json in form. 

**Postman Pre-request Script Usage**  
While creating a user via Postman, you should send a post request to **/auth/signup** endpoint. In the request use the JSON schema below as **raw body**. Do not change **{{password}}**, it is an environment variable in Postman.
```json
{
    "name": "Erhan Yakut",
    "email": "erhan@passwall.io",
    "master_password": "{{password}}"
}
```

Then in Pre-request Script, copy and paste the javascript code below. You should change the password in the code.
```javascript
var newPassword = '123456' // Change this

pm.environment.set('password', newPassword);

var encryptedPassword = CryptoJS.SHA256(pm.environment.get('password')).toString();

pm.environment.set('password',encryptedPassword);

console.log(encryptedPassword);
```

## Database support
PassWall works with **PostgreSQL** databases. 

## Configuration
When PassWall Server starts, it automatically generates **config.yml** in the folders below:  
**MacOS:** $HOME/Library/Application Support/passwall-server  
**Windows:** $APPDATA/passwall-server  
**Linux:** $HOME/.config/passwall-server  


## Security
1. PassWall uses The Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) encryption algorithm with Galois/Counter Mode (GCM) symmetric-key cryptographic mode. Passwords encrypted with AES can only be decrypted with the passphrase defined in the **config.yml** file.

2. Endpoints are protected with security middlewares against attacks like XSS.

3. Against SQL injection, PassWall uses Gorm package to handle database queries which clears all queries.

4. There is rate limiter for signin attempts against brute force attacks.

## Environment Variables
These environment variables are accepted:

**Server Variables:**
- PORT
- PW_SERVER_USERNAME
- PW_SERVER_PASSWORD
- PW_SERVER_PASSPHRASE
- PW_SERVER_SECRET
- PW_SERVER_TIMEOUT  
- PW_SERVER_GENERATED_PASSWORD_LENGTH 
- PW_SERVER_ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_DURATION
- PW_SERVER_REFRESH_TOKEN_EXPIRE_DURATION 
  
**Database Variables**
- PW_DB_NAME
- PW_DB_USERNAME
- PW_DB_PASSWORD
- PW_DB_HOST
- PW_DB_PORT
- PW_DB_LOG_MODE

**Backup Variables**
- PW_BACKUP_FOLDER
- PW_BACKUP_ROTATION
- PW_BACKUP_PERIOD

## Development usage
Install Go to your computer. Pull the server repo. Execute the command in server folder.

```
go run ./cmd/passwall-server
```

## Docker

```
docker-compose up --build
```

## Hello Contributors

1. Don't send too much commit at once. It will be easier for us to do a code review.

1. Be sure to take a look at the dev branch. The version I am working on is there.

1. First try to fix `// TODO:`s in the code.

1. Then you can contribute to the development by following the mile stones.

1. Don't mess with the user interface. The design guide has not been released yet.
